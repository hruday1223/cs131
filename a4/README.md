The issue that I tried to fix was instead of leaving the year column blank after the dash for the tv shows that haven't ended yet, we could say (2013-present) for example instead of just (2013- ).
What I did was substitute anything that had '- ' with '-present' because we only see '- ' within the year where the tv show hasn't ended yet.
